Agenda:
    1.	Figure out what the app will do and how it will work.
    2.	Assign tasks for the pages and discuss design ideas.

⸻

Core Focus (App Overview):
    •	The app will help users easily calculate their capital gains tax (CGT) for cryptocurrency transactions.
    •	It will have four main pages:
            1.	Introductory Page
            2.	Upload Data Page
            3.	Visualise Data Page
            4.	Share Data Page
    •	The goal is to make tracking and calculating crypto taxes simple and easy for users.
    •	Users will sign up, upload their transaction data, see their tax calculations, and have the option to share data with others.

Page Breakdown & Design Tasks:
    •	Introductory Page [Jordy]
        •	This page will explain what the app does (e.g., “Easily calculate your crypto capital gains tax”).
        •	It will have a “Join today!” button that lets users either sign up or log in.
        •	The page needs to look welcoming and clear, making it easy for new users to get started.
    •	Upload Data Page [Cam]
        •	Here, users will select their brokerage and upload their transaction data.
        •	Options for uploading data could be either entering it manually or using a CSV file.
        •	Consider integrating Koinly’s API for automatic data import if necessary.
        •	The page needs to be easy to use and intuitive.
    •	Visualise Data Page [Nick]
        •	This page will show users their tax calculations and transaction history.
        •	It will have graphs or tables to display the data clearly.
        •	The goal is to make this page simple to understand, even for people who aren’t tech-savvy.
    •	Share Data Page [Harry]
        •	This page will let users share their data with others (e.g., accountants).
        •	We need to think about permissions: who can see and share the data.
        •	The page should be straightforward and secure for sharing data.

⸻

User Roles:
    •	Users: Regular users who can upload data, view their results, and track their crypto tax calculations.
    •	Admins/Experts: A higher level of user (name to be decided), who might have access to more features, such as viewing other users’ data or providing help.
    •	We need to decide on the permissions for these two types of users.

⸻

Action Items:
1.	Design Research:
    •	Each person needs to choose a design layout for their assigned page and share their ideas with the team by the end of the week.
2.	User Roles and Permissions:
    •	Decide exactly what each user type (regular user vs. admin/expert) can and can’t do.
    •	Clarify if admins/experts can access other users’ data.

⸻

Project Requirements:
    1.	User Login and Signup:
        •	Users must be able to create an account or log in securely.
    2.	Data Upload Options:
        •	Users can upload crypto transaction data either manually or via CSV.
        •	Consider integrating with Koinly’s API for automatic data uploads.
    3.	Visualising Data:
        •	Provide clear visualisations (graphs, tables) of users’ tax calculations.
    4.	Sharing Data:
        •	Users can share their data with others, such as accountants or other users.
        •	Ensure data privacy and security.

⸻

Next Steps / Upcoming Milestones:
    1.	Compare Designs:
        •	Everyone will complete their research and present their design ideas by the end of the week.
    2.	Finalise User Roles:
        •	Decide what permissions each user type (regular users and admins/experts) will have.
    3.	Start Frontend Development:
        •	Once design ideas are decided, we can start building the frontend pages.

⸻

Summary:
•	The team decided to focus on a cryptocurrency CGT calculation app, which will have at least four main pages: an introductory page, a data upload page, a data visualisation page, and a data sharing page.
•	Each team member has been assigned a specific page to design, and we’ll compare ideas by the end of the week.
•	We also discussed two user types: regular users and admins/experts, and will need to finalise permissions for each.
•	Next steps include finalising designs and user roles before moving on to coding the app.
