Agenda:
	1.	Project Kickoff
	•	Introduction and overview of the project.
	2.	Brainstorming Ideas
	•	Ideas for Deliberation:
	•	Track Lap Times Logging: An app for logging and tracking lap times, such as for racing or other time-based activities.
	•	Cryptocurrency Tax Report App: An app that takes cryptocurrency transactions and calculates capital gains tax (CTG) reports, using uploaded CSVs or manual data entry.

⸻

Core Focus (Ideas for Development):
	•	Engagement, Effectiveness, and Ease of Use:
The app should be user-friendly and designed for engagement, ensuring it is intuitive and efficient for users.
	•	Track Lap Times Logging:
This feature will allow users to log and track their lap times. It could be applied to sports or personal improvement tracking.
	•	Koinly Integration for Capital Gains Tax:
	•	Users can upload CSV files from cryptocurrency exchanges or manually input transactions.
	•	Koinly API integration to automatically generate tax reports, making it easier for users to track crypto capital gains for tax purposes.

Action Items:
	1.	Get Everyone on GitHub:
Ensure all team members are onboarded to GitHub and have access to the project repository for version control and collaboration.
	2.	Find Website Designs We Like:
Research and gather inspiration for website layouts and designs that align with the team’s vision for the app. Focus on functional and visually appealing designs.

⸻

Project Requirements:
	1.	Login Portal:
A secure login system to authenticate users and grant access to the app’s features.
	2.	Database (SQL + Python with Flask):
	•	The app will need a database to store user data, lap times, and cryptocurrency transaction information.
	•	Use SQL for database management and Python with Flask for backend development and API integration.
	3.	Data Input Methods:
	•	Manual Entry: Allow users to manually input lap times or crypto transaction data.
	•	Batch Uploads (CSV): Support CSV file uploads containing multiple entries at once.
	•	API Token (Koinly Integration): Enable users to easily upload cryptocurrency transaction data through Koinly’s accessible API token.

⸻

Next Steps / Upcoming Milestones:
	1.	Frontend Design Discussion:
Continue researching website design inspirations. Once the design style is decided, move forward with creating wireframes and mockups.
	2.	Koinly Integration Research:
Investigate Koinly’s API documentation to understand how to fetch cryptocurrency data and calculate capital gains tax. Ensure smooth integration of the CSV upload feature and API interaction.

⸻

Summary:
	•	The meeting focused on the core ideas for the app, brainstorming potential features for tracking lap times and generating cryptocurrency tax reports.
	•	Action items were assigned, including setting up GitHub, researching website designs, and further investigation of Koinly’s API for crypto tax integration.
	•	The next steps include progressing with frontend design and backend API integration research for Koinly.
